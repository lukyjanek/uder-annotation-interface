# JDIM DEMO: Interface for manual annotation
Tis is a demo version of the web-browser tool for facilitating the process of manual annotations of word-formation relations in the data resources such as DeriNet and resources from the Universal Derivations (UDer) collection. I developed the tool for the event *A day with informatics and mathematics* (*Jeden den s informatikou a matematikou*) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in January 2023.

All terms of use of this demo version remains the same as for the full version of the annotation interface.
