# Interface for manual annotation
The web-browser tool for facilitating the process of manual annotations of word-formation relations in the data resources such as DeriNet and resources from the Universal Derivations (UDer) collection. I developed the tool and utilised it during the harmonisation of the existing data resources into the UDer collection.


## Usage
The tools is available online on [https://lukyjanek.github.io/subpages/uder-annotation-interface/UDerAnnotation.html](https://lukyjanek.github.io/subpages/uder-annotation-interface/UDerAnnotation.html).
It was tested in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
